Currently, I am a second year PhD student in Data Science at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST)](https://www.stanford.edu/), 
advised by [Prof. Jia Li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia) and [Prof. Xiaofang Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/xiaofang-zhou/home).

Previously, I received my MPhil degree in Intelligent Systems Engineering from the Sun Yat-sen University in 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised 
by [Prof. Xiaodan Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=voxznZAAAAAJ&hl). I obtained my bachelor degree in Mathematics from Soochow University in 2019.
